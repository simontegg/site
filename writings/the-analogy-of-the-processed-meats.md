# The Analaogy of the Processed Meats

A couple of years ago I hit upon a useful analogy for a common but under-discussed flavour of organisational dysfunction. I called it "selling dogfood as pâté when luncheon meat is readily available". The analogy refers to the practice to spend effort creating and refining some unique process, or tool, or structure and convincing people that the process is really wonderful, instead of focusing on what's really important: people,mindsets, and relationships.

In order to really "get" this analogy its advisable to have background in both meat products and startups, and to not think too deeply -just give it a quick pass over before it breaks down. We're low-brow analogising here, not revealing deeper truths.

For the benefit of readers without such backgrounds I will spend the next few paragraphs detailing the constituent parts before assembling into a glorious super-analogy whole. First up, "dogfood".

## Dogfood

In the startup world "to dogfood", "dogfooding", or "to eat your own dogfood" refers to a practice where the people building a software product make regular use of it, especially in the product's early stages, and even if doing so is frustrating. By "dogfooding" the product team experiences the same day-to-day, often subconscious annoyances that their users experience. While "dogfooders" acknowledge their product is (currently) kind of shit, and using it is like eating dogfood, they believe that this extended exercise in user empathy will ultimately lead them to vastly improve it.


## Luncheon Meat

When my brother and I were teenagers and on our way to 6 foot 2 inches we could each demolish half a chicken and packet of biscuits as a light after-school snack. Our mother, with an eye to budgetary concerns, made sure that the fridge was always well-stocked with luncheon meat and would influence our snack decisions in luncheon meat's direction. To those of you unfamiliar with luncheon meat its probably the cheapest, sandwich-ready sources of protein available in the New Zealand supermarket. The some butter, a few slices of lucncheon meat, and squirt of tomato sauce

The key points for our analogy is that luncheon meat is cheap, unpretentious protein source.
