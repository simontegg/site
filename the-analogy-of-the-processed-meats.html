<h1>The Analaogy of the Processed Meats</h1>
<p>A couple of years ago I hit upon a useful analogy for a common but under-discussed flavour of organisational dysfunction: <em>selling dogfood as pâté when luncheon meat is readily available</em>. The analogy refers to <em>process fetishism</em>. Creating and refining a unique process, or tool, or structure (dogfood) and convincing people that the process is universally wonderful (pâté); instead of using something, uncomplicated and &quot;off the shelf&quot; (luncheon meat) and spending energy on what really matters: people, mindsets, and relationships.</p>
<p>To really get this analogy its advisable to have background in both meat products and startups; and to not think too deeply, just give it a quick pass over before it breaks down. We're low-brow analogising here, not uncovering deeper truths. For the benefit of readers without such backgrounds the next few paragraphs detail the analogy's constituent parts before assemblage into a glorious super-analogy whole. First up, &quot;dogfood&quot;.</p>

<h2>Dogfood</h2>
<p>In the startup world &quot;to dogfood&quot;, &quot;dogfooding&quot;, or &quot;to eat your own dogfood&quot; is when the same people who build a software product also make regular use of it, especially in the product's early stages, and even if doing so is frustrating. By &quot;dogfooding&quot; the product team experiences the same day-to-day, often subconscious annoyances that their users experience. While &quot;dogfooders&quot; acknowledge their product is (currently) kind of shit, and using it is like eating dogfood, they believe that this extended exercise in user empathy will ultimately lead them to vastly improve it.</p>
<p>Dogfooding is a valuable process, but I've noticed dogfooders can become a bit...<em>dog-matic</em>..., in their belief that following this process all but guarantees product success.</p>
<p>You can also dogfood process improvements. When running a new process as long as participants are open about the process's weak points the same principles of fast feedback and improvement apply.</p>

<h2>Luncheon Meat</h2>
<p>When my brother and I were teenagers we could each easily demolish half a chicken and packet of biscuits as a light after-school snack. Our mother, with an eye to budgetary concerns, made sure that the fridge was always well-stocked with luncheon meat and would influence our snack decisions in luncheon meat's direction. Luncheon meat is probably the cheapest, sandwich-ready sources of protein available in the New Zealand supermarket.</p>
<p>The key points for our analogy is that luncheon meat is cheap, uncomplicated, unpretentious protein source. &quot;Luncheon meat&quot; organisations don't bother with developing their own processes, and are happy</p>
